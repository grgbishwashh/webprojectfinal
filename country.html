					<h2>Rules</h2>

				</div>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Teams: Each team consists of seven players on the field and several substitutes.</li>
						<li>Playing Area: The field is divided into two halves, with a midline dividing them. Each team defends its own half while trying to raid the opponent's half.</li>
						<li>Raids: A player, known as the "raider," enters the opponent's half to tag defenders. The raider must touch as many opponents as possible and return to their half within a specific time limit, all while continuously chanting "kabaddi."</li>
						<li>Defending: The defending team tries to prevent the raider from crossing back to their half. Defenders can tag the raider by touching them, and successful tags eliminate the raider from the round.</li>
						<li>Tagging and Points: Defenders earn points by successfully tagging the raider. The raider scores a point for each defender tagged and safely returning to their half.</li>
						<li>Bonus Line: The raider can earn additional points by crossing the bonus line during a raid. This is typically a line within the opponent's half.</li>
						<li>Touch or All-Out: If a raider manages to touch all seven opponents, it is called an "All-Out," and the raider's team earns additional points. If the defending team successfully stops the raider, they prevent an All-Out.</li>
						<li>Substitution: Teams can substitute players during stoppages in play.</li>
						<li>Duration: A standard Kabaddi match is divided into two halves, each lasting a specific duration, often 20 minutes at the professional level.</li>
						<li>Winning: The team with the most points at the end of the match is declared the winner. In the case of a tie, extra time or additional rounds may be played.</li>

				<h1>Sumo Wrestling</h1>
				<h1>Japan</h1>
				<h2>Rules</h2>

			</div>
			<p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, has specific rules governing its play. Here's a summary of some basic table tennis rules:

				<ol>
					<li>Objective: The goal in Sumo is to force your opponent out of the ring (dohy≈ç) or make any part of their body, other than the soles of their feet, touch the ground.
					<li>Ring: The ring is a circular area covered in clay with a diameter of about 4.55 meters. It is marked by rice-straw bales and white lines.
					<li>Pre-match Rituals: Before a match, wrestlers perform a series of rituals, including salt throwing to purify the ring and stomp their feet to drive away evil spirits.
					<li>Attire: Sumo wrestlers wear a distinctive outfit called a mawashi, a belt-like loincloth. Traditionally, the color of the mawashi indicates the wrestler's rank.
					<li>Starting the Match: Wrestlers start the match by crouching down and placing their hands on the ground. They face each other and await the referee's signal to begin.
					<li>Winning Techniques:
						<ol type="i">
						<li>Yorikiri: Forcing the opponent out of the ring by pushing them.</li>
						<li>Oshidashi: Pushing the opponent out of the ring without maintaining physical contact.</li>
						<li>Tsukiotoshi: Winning by thrusting or pushing down the opponent.</li>
						<li>Hatakikomi: Winning by slapping the opponent down.</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Losing Techniques: If any part of a wrestler's body, other than the soles of their feet, touches the ground, they lose. This includes falling or being pushed out of the ring.
					<li>Re-matches: If the initial charge results in a double-handed slap without a grip, or if there's an unclear start, a re-match may be called.
					<li>Ranking System: Sumo has a hierarchical ranking system with various divisions. Wrestlers move up or down in rank based on their performance in tournaments.
					<li>Tournaments: Professional Sumo consists of six major tournaments (basho) held throughout the year, each lasting 15 days. Wrestlers compete to improve their records and climb the rankings.
					<li>Kinboshi: If a maegashira (lower-ranked wrestler) defeats a yokozuna (highest-ranked wrestler), they earn a special prize called a kinboshi.
					<li>Forbidden Techniques: Certain techniques, such as hair-pulling, eye-poking, and striking with a closed fist, are prohibited.
