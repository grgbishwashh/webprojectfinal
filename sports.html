				<h1>Basketball</h1>
				<h2>Rules</h2>

			</div>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Teams: Each team has five players on the court at a time.</li>
					<li>Scoring: Points are scored by shooting the ball through the opponent's basket. A field goal from beyond the three-point arc is worth three points, and a shot inside the arc is worth two points. Free throws, awarded after certain fouls, are worth one point each.</li>
					<li>Game Duration: A standard basketball game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes (NBA) or 10 minutes (FIBA/international play).</li>
					<li>Possession and Shot Clock: Teams alternate possession of the ball, and they have a limited time (shot clock) to attempt a shot (usually 24 seconds in the NBA and 14 seconds in FIBA).</li>
					<li>Dribbling: Players must dribble the ball (bounce it on the floor) while moving. Double dribbling (starting to dribble again after stopping) is not allowed.</li>

					<li>Fouls: Personal fouls are called for illegal physical contact. Teams enter the bonus situation after a certain number of team fouls, leading to free throws for the opposing team.</li>
					<li>Free Throws: Awarded for certain fouls. Players shoot from a designated free-throw line, and each successful shot is worth one point.</li>
					<li>Substitutions: Teams can substitute players during stoppages in play.</li>

					<li>Backcourt Violation: Once a team advances the ball past the half-court line, they cannot move it back into their own backcourt.</li>

				<h1>Table Tennis</h1>
				<h2>Rules</h2>

			</div>
			<p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, has specific rules governing its play. Here's a summary of some basic table tennis rules:

				<ol>
					<li>Scoring: A game is played to 11 points, and a player must win by at least two points. Matches are usually best of 5 or 7 games.</li>
					<li>Serve: The ball must be thrown vertically at least 6 inches before being struck. The server must hit the ball on their side of the table, and it must bounce once on their side before crossing the net.</li>
					<li>Service Rotation: In singles, each player serves two points in a row, and in doubles, each team serves two points in a row. The serve alternates between opponents or teams.</li>
					<li>Ball in Play: The ball must be struck so that it bounces once on each side of the table. If the ball hits the net and goes over during a serve, it's a let, and the serve is retaken.</li>
					<li>Scoring during Play: A point is scored if the opponent fails to return the ball within the rules. Points can also be won if the opponent commits certain infractions, such as hitting the ball twice in succession.</li>
					<li>Change of Ends: Players switch ends of the table after every odd-numbered game in a match.</li>
					<li>Continuous Play: After each point, the server quickly retrieves the ball and serves again. There are no breaks between points, except for a 1-minute break when one player or team reaches 5 points in the deciding game.</li>
					<li>Let: A let is called if a point is interrupted or a service is disrupted for some reason. The point or serve is replayed.</li>
					<li>Equipment: Players use a table tennis racket (paddle or bat) to hit the ball. The ball must be made of celluloid or a similar plastic material.</li>
					<li>Doubles Play: In doubles, players on the same team alternate hitting the ball. The ball must bounce on each side of the table during play.</li>
